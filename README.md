## About Chip-8
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.

## Usage
```Python
python3 main.py {ROM_file_name.ch8}
# python3 "main.py pong (alt).ch8"
```

#### Requirements
```
pip3 install pygame
```
